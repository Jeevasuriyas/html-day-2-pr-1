    <p>Physical self-care involves taking deliberate actions to maintain and improve bodily health. Regular exercise is a cornerstone of physical self-care. Engaging in activities like walking, jogging, yoga, or team sports not only keeps the body fit but also releases endorphins, the body's natural stress relievers. Adequate sleep is another critical component, as it allows the body to repair and rejuvenate, enhancing cognitive function and emotional regulation. Additionally, a balanced diet rich in nutrients fuels the body and mind, supporting overall health. Regular medical check-ups and following medical advice further ensure that one stays on top of potential health issues.</p>
